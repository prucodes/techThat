							<h2>What is Wage Theft?</h2>
							<p><strong>Wage Theft</strong>is the nonpayment or under-payment of wages.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Employees are not paid minimum wage or overtime</li>
								<li>Employees do not receive a final paycheck</li>
								<li>Employees are not paid for time worked</li>
								<li>Employers misclassify employees as  independent contractors to avoid paying minimum wage and overtime</li>
								<li>Employers take illegal deductions from an employee’s paycheck</li>
							</ul>
						</div> <hr>

						<div>
							<h2>What are the federal laws prohibiting Job Discrimination?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Civil Rights Act of 1964</li>
								<li>Equal Pay Act of 1963</li>
								<li>Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967</li>
								<li>Title I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</li>
								<li>Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</li>
								<li>Civil Rights Act of 1991</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are other federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination and retaliation and some state and local regulations may apply.</p>
						</div> <hr>

						<div>
							<h2>Can I sue for a Hostile Work Environment?</h2>
							<p>Verbal or physical conduct based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or retaliation, may amount to unlawful harassment.  If the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment; or if a supervisor’s harassing conduct results in a tangible change in an employee’s employment status or benefits (demotion, termination, failure to promote, etc.), there may be a right to sue.</p>
						</div> <hr>

						<div>
							<h2>My boss says I’m a contractor. Does that mean I cannot get overtime pay?</h2>
							<p>Even "contractors" can be entitled to overtime pay.  How your boss labels you may not matter under federal law. Accordingly to the Department of Labor, the factors that a court will consider are: 1) The extent to which the work performed is an integral part of the employer’s business; 2) Whether the worker’s managerial skills affect his or her opportunity for profit and loss; 3) The relative investments in facilities and equipment by the worker and the employer; 4) The worker’s skill and initiative; 5) The permanency of the worker’s relationship with the employer; and 6) The nature and degree of control by the employer.</p>
						</div> <hr>

						<div>
							<h2>Does my employer have to pay me overtime and my “fringes” on government funded projects?</h2>
							<p>Yes. Recently a federal appeals court ruled that when the FLSA requires overtime be not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which the worker is employed, the ‘regular rate’ to be used for this calculus is the rate set forth under the Davis Bacon Act. <i>See Jorge Amaya v. Power Design, Inc.,</i> 15-1691 (4th Cir. 2016)</p>
